In severe cases removal or modification of character skills, attributes and belongings, as well as the permanent removal of accounts without any compensation may be considered. The sanction is based on the seriousness of the rule violation and the previous record of the player. It is determined by the gamemaster imposing the banishment.\r\n\r\nThese rules may be changed at any time. All changes will be announced on the official website.', 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0);
